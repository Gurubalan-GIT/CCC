## Getting started :
This is a colloborative program for competitive coding, from scratch, till: Well let's say _advanced_. Multiple lanugages.

## Contributors 

  - ## What to do currently? 

    Right as of now, people who are well versed in the topics can start pushing in their comfortable language. For the people who are beginners, worry not, you can do too, and if you have doubts, raise it as issues. The readme file will get updated with videos and material guidelines for Git and other coding topics as well, so please be patient. 

    You guys can follow the file structure which is just a template idea for now, so you know where to push what, but you have more topics? A different lanugage? No problem. Feel free to create and add new stuff. 

    ```
    *Important* : Do update your @Username links in the contributors section!
    ```
    If any problems arrive communicate through the group or through Issues as well. Happy coding, guys! 

  - ## To-do 

    - [ ] Complete the [Read-me.md](/README.md) documentation.
    - [ ] Add all the contributors and add them to [contributers](/contributing.md/#contributers) in the [contributing.md](/contributing.md) documentation.
    - [ ] Create the file structure boiler plate to start pushing code. 
    - [ ] Update contribution guidelines with file name syntax and code guidelines in [contributing.md](/contributing.md). 
    - [ ] Clean up the Read-me files inside each folder created for file structure purposes and replace them with proper documentation with links for the coding questions pushed.  
    - [ ] File name syntax will be updated later. (Start pushing code in the given topics or even add more by creating a new folder!)
    
  - ## Communication

    Communication is done through a LinkedIn group, join [here](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/10453094/). Other code related doubts, reviews can be put up as Github issues. Even recommendations, changes, ideas and so on for this repository. 

  - ## Git

    New to Git? No worries. Assuming you have created an account and reading this, go ahead and download the CLI interface for GIT, [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
    Don't like the CLI interface? Then try out the GUI version powered by electron [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
    After the installation, do these steps: 

    ``` 
    $ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
    $ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
    ```
    Want to clone and push to this repository?
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Gurubalan-GIT/CCC
    ```

  - ## Coding 
    - C/C++
      - Install [TCC-MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler for executing and compiling C and C++ files.
      - Set the path to the bin of TCC by going to *Environment variables* and adding a new path.
      - Open command line and run the commands `gcc -o outputfile filename.c` and `outputfilename.exe` for C.
      - Respectively for C++, `g++ -o outputfile filename.cpp` and `outputfilename.exe`. _This is for compilation and execution._
    - Java 
      - Install the latest [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) and set path to bin.
      
      - _**Disclaimer: JDK 11 cannot be used for professional use. Stick with JDK 8 for avoiding your application from getting stripped down.**_
      - Setting path is easy as this - `C:\Guru> set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\bin`. _Run this in cmd._
      - Open command line and run `C:\Guru> javac filename.java` and `C:\Guru> java filename`.
      - _Important: Rename `.java` files to the respective class names `(Having PSVM)` or vice-versa for compilation._
    - Python 
      - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for _Windows._
      - Set the path and enter `python` in cmd to enter the python shell.
      - To execute a script file run `python filename.py`.
